// streams definitions used by TADMA
// Each stream is defined by Destination MAC, VLAN
// and time trigger in nano sec. The time trigger is 
// relative to start of QBV cycle.
// Say if Qbv Cycle time is 1ms stream0 can be 
// time triggered at 100uS and stream1 at 200uS and so on..
// All units are in nsec
// Time trigger tells when to fetch frames.
// count: 1 to 4 frames to fetch per trigger.
// if count is 0, the corresponding stream is transmitted in continuous mode.
// Number of stream entries should be between 1 and 8.
// note: The HW fetches the packet at fetch_time which is
// fetch_time = (trigger - fetch_offset)
// The default fetch_offset = 5uSec
//
// If current stream's (fetch_time + (tot_time_to_fetch_pkt_by_hw) > 
// 		next streams fetch_time)
//	if(skip) is set, then next stream is skipped, 
//	if not next stream is delayed.
// skip can be enabled/disabled through sysfs entry
